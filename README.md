*Worldwide Causes of Death

*Worldwide Disease Analysis (1990-2015)
-The top 2 deaths worldwide are caused by Cardiovascular Diseases and Neoplasms (Malignant Cancer/Tumor) which have gradually increased over this time period.
-Cardiovascular diseases and Neoplasms caused nearly half of the deaths worldwide during this timeline.
-Total amount of deaths increases over this time period which may coincide with the total population increase worldwide.

*Top 5 Diseases Analysis
-The discrepancy between the top ranked cause of death and the 5th ranked cause of death is more than 5 times the amount.

*My question was: What is the leading cause of death in the world? To answer this, I first graphed all the diseases, all the years, across all the countries at once on a heatmap. After doing that, I was able to see that the Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) and Neoplasms were the most common causes of death regardless of the year or place. 

*I wanted to take a closer look at the cardiovascular numbers and unpack what continents were causing such high numbers. I found and merged a continents csv file with the original dataframe. I split the world into continents and graphed each continent's CVD number of deaths across the years. Working with the raw numbers, I found that Asia by far had the highest number of CVD cases compared to any another continent, across all 30 years. It also showed that those cases were increasing as time went on. 

*Since Asia's population accounts for almost 60% of the world's population, the previous described graph isn't surprising. Further, the increased rate can be explained by the increasing total world population. But do these trends stay the same when we adjust for each continents population? My next question was: When we adjust for population, which continent have the highest number of CVD causes compared to other causes of death? We merged another CSV file that accounted for each country's population, and then created a new col for those respective percentages (number of deaths causes by CVD in country/total country population). We again re-plotted the graph to show that in fact Europe has the highest percentage of CVD disease cases by a landslide. 

*What does this mean? This means that although Asia has the highest population in the world, and therefore the highest number of CVD cases in the world, the percentage of CVD cases is the highest in Europe. 20% of the deaths in Europe were causes by CVD where as other continents only had 3-7%.
